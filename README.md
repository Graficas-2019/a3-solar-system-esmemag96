# Assignment 3 SolarSystem

Assignment No 3 for the computer graphics course. Using three.js, create a solar system

**Rubric:**

- Create 8 planets (and pluto), with their respective moons, the sun, and the asteroid field.
- The planets and moons can be created as spheres.
- EXTRA: For the asteroids, and some of the moons, investigate how to load the geometry from an obj or json file.
- Planets and moons must have their own rotation.
- The moons have to rotate around the planets, and the planets have to rotate around the sun.
- Draw the orbit that each planet follows.
- Each element must have its own materials, with textures, and normal or bump maps.
- Most textures can be found here: http://planetpixelemporium.com/
- The panning and rotation of the system has to be controlled using an orbit controller.

**Deadline:** 19/02/19 14:30 hrs

**Grade: 90**

**Feedback**
The light has to come from the sun. You had to use a point light located at the sun, not a directional light. To get the sun to show, you could have used a basic material for the sun.
The orbit controller is not working as it should: it seems that the system is rotating, instead of the camera rotating around the system.
